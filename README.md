# PS2 controller Arduino Library v1.8
Original code by Shutter on Arduino Forums. Later revamped and made into a library by [Bill Porter](www.billporter.info). Other contributors include 
 - Eric Wetzel (thewetzel@gmail.com)
 - Kurt Eckhardt
 - Timothy Brown (tabrownies@gmail.com)

## Installation
 1. unzip and place 'PS2X_lib' folder into your 'C:\Users\{user name}\Documents\Arduino\libraries' folder or '{Arduino IDE path}\hardware\libraries" or {Arduino IDE path}\libraries" directory. 
 1. Restart the Arduino IDE, and open up the example sketch. 
     - All uses of the library are in the example sketch. 

## Version History
 - 0.1 made into library, added analog stick support. 
 - 0.2 fixed config_gamepad miss-spelling
     - added new functions:
         - NewButtonState();
         - NewButtonState(unsigned int);
         - ButtonPressed(unsigned int);
         - ButtonReleased(unsigned int);
     - removed 'PS' from begining of ever function
 - 1.0 found and fixed bug that wasn't configuring controller
     - added ability to define pins
     - added time checking to reconfigure controller if not polled enough
     - Analog sticks and pressures all through 'ps2x.Analog()' function
     - added:
         - enableRumble();
         - enablePressures();
 - 1.1  
     - added some debug stuff for end user. Reports if no controller found
     - added auto-increasing sentence delay to see if it helps compatibility.
 - 1.2
     - found bad math by Shutter for original clock. Was running at 50kHz, not the required 500kHz. 
    fixed some of the debug reporting. 
 - 1.3 
     - Changed clock back to 50kHz. CuriousInventor says it's suppose to be 500kHz, but doesn't seem to work for everybody. 
 - 1.4
     - Removed redundant functions.
     - Fixed mode check to include two other possible modes the controller could be in.
         - Added debug code enabled by compiler directives. See below to enable debug mode.
     - Added button definitions for shapes as well as colors.
 - 1.41
     - Some simple bug fixes
     - Added Keywords.txt file
 - 1.5
     - Added proper Guitar Hero compatibility
     - Fixed issue with DEBUG mode, had to send serial at once instead of in bits
 - 1.6
     - Changed config_gamepad() call to include rumble and pressures options
         - This was to fix controllers that will only go into config mode once
         - Old methods should still work for backwards compatibility 
 - 1.7
     - Integrated Kurt's fixes for the interrupts messing with servo signals
     - Reorganized directory so examples show up in Arduino IDE menu
 - 1.8
     - Added Arduino 1.0 compatibility.
 - 1.9
     - Kurt - Added detection and recovery from dropping from analog mode, plus
     - integrated Chipkit (pic32mx...) support

## If you have problems

Open up the PS2X_lib.h file and change (remove the comment markers)

```c++
// $$$$$$$$$$$$ DEBUG ENABLE SECTION $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
// to debug ps2 controller, uncomment these two lines to print out debug to uart

//#define PS2X_DEBUG
//#define PS2X_COM_DEBUG
```
to 
```c++
// $$$$$$$$$$$$ DEBUG ENABLE SECTION $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
// to debug ps2 controller, uncomment these two lines to print out debug to uart

#define PS2X_DEBUG
#define PS2X_COM_DEBUG
```

This enables debug messages. Save the file, and recompile the example sketch. Open up the terminal
and watch what is written. If the problem is not something obvious, dump the serial output into a comment on my website and I will try
to help you.
